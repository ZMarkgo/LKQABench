How can this unprotected access lead to concurrency issues, and is it considered safe practice?",
		"answer" : "Accessing `rf_change_in_progress` without the spinlock risks race conditions because other threads might modify the variable after the check. While some architectures ensure atomic reads/writes for aligned variables, this is not guaranteed across all platforms. The code's design allows threads to poll the variable without blocking others, but stale or inconsistent reads could cause infinite retries or missed updates. To ensure safety, either hold the spinlock during checks or use atomic operations with appropriate memory barriers.",

		"answer" : "The spinlock `rf_ps_lock` ensures mutual exclusion during the write operation in the `else` block. When a thread enters this block, it holds the lock, preventing other threads from simultaneously acquiring it. Only one thread can execute the critical section (setting `rf_change_in_progress = true`) at a time.

Could the unprotected access allow the loop to run indefinitely?",
		"answer" : "The timeout mechanism may fail to prevent infinite waiting because the unprotected read of `rf_change_in_progress` allows the variable to change after each check. If another thread sets it to `false` and back to `true` between iterations, `rf_wait_counter` resets, extending the loop indefinitely.

		"answer" : "The issue stems from using sizeof(skb), which returns the size of the pointer (8 bytes on 64-bit systems) instead of the size of the entire sk_buff structure. This copies only the pointer's memory address, not the full struct data, leading to memory corruption. Instead, use kernel functions like skb_clone() or skb_copy() to properly duplicate the sk_buff.
